# Hand-landmarks-classification

## Overview
This project implements a hand landmarks classification system using machine learning techniques. It leverages the Mediapipe library for hand landmark detection and various machine learning models for gesture classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of hand landmark coordinates extracted using Mediapipe from the HaGRID Dataset. It includes 21 keypoints for each hand, with x,y and z coordinates, and labels representing different hand gestures.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Label encoding
  - Data normalization using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler
  - Handling missing values and duplicates
  
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Random Forest Classifier (Grid Search Optimization)
  - Support Vector Classifier (Grid Search Optimization) âœ… Best Model (Accuracy: 97.9%)
  - XGBoost Classifier (Grid Search Optimization)
  - Extra Trees Classifier (Grid Search Optimization)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (Grid Search Optimization)

- **Visualization:**
  - 2D and 3D visualization of hand landmarks
  - Confusion matrix for model evaluation

- **Deployment:**
  - Live video processing using OpenCV and Mediapipe
  - Real-time gesture recognition and annotation
